# CaffePR repo for CircleCI

This repo is for CI/CD enabled through CircleCI. The frontend and backend were added as submodules using `git submodule', hence, each code base holds its own separate repo, also public.

## Setup

To test the frontend or backend on your local machine please go to the corresponding repo and read the README.
